## Introduction
As a developer, in the daily development process, we often need to use a variety of tools, and at the same time, we also accumulate a lot of knowledge and experiences.

In reality, these tools are often scattered across different websites or offline tools, making it difficult for us to manage and integrate them effectively.

The main goal of this project is to focus on personal resource integration:
1. It serves as a bookmark tool, allowing you to aggregate web pages and knowledge points you have collected on the Internet.
2. It serves as a notebook, enabling you to record the knowledge, experiences, and inspirations you have gained in development or daily life.
3. It acts as a toolbox, containing any small tools you use during development, eliminating the need to constantly switch between different places and allowing you to focus more on your work.
4. It can be anything you want it to be.

The backend of the project adopts a microservices architecture, while the frontend is based on [qiankun](https://github.com/kuitos/qiankun#readme) for micro frontends. This setup allows developers to flexibly build their own applications.
